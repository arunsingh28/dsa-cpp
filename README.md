## 📌 Explanation

### 🔹 Linear Data Structures
1. **Array**: A fixed-size collection of elements stored sequentially in memory.
2. **Linked List**: A collection of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
   - **Singly Linked List**: Each node has a pointer to the next node.
   - **Doubly Linked List**: Each node has pointers to both previous and next nodes.
   - **Circular Linked List**: The last node points to the first node, forming a circle.
3. **Stack**: A LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure used for expression evaluation, recursion, etc.
4. **Queue**: A FIFO (First In, First Out) structure used in scheduling.
   - **Simple Queue**: Insertion at the rear and deletion at the front.
   - **Circular Queue**: The last element connects to the first, forming a circle.
   - **Priority Queue**: Elements are dequeued based on priority.
   - **Deque**: Double-ended queue allowing insertion and deletion from both ends.

### 🔹 Non-Linear Data Structures
1. **Trees**: Hierarchical structures with a root node and sub-nodes.
   - **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children.
   - **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where left nodes contain smaller values and right nodes contain greater values.
   - **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree.
   - **B-Tree**: A general tree structure used in databases.
   - **Red-Black Tree**: A self-balancing BST with color properties.
   - **Heap**: A complete binary tree used in priority queues (Min Heap / Max Heap).
2. **Graphs**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
   - **Directed Graph**: Edges have direction.
   - **Undirected Graph**: Edges do not have direction.
   - **Weighted Graph**: Edges have weights (costs associated with traversal).
   - **Unweighted Graph**: No weights assigned to edges.
   - **Cyclic / Acyclic Graph**: Determines whether cycles exist in the graph.
